# Snipcord

Snipcord brings Snapchat-like functionality to Discord, allowing users to send ephemeral snaps (selfies) to each other directly within Discord! The snaps are sent as spoiler-protected images that disappear after a set duration, replicating the ephemeral experience of Snapchat.

## Features
- **Snap Command**: Use the `/snap` command in Discord to send a snap to a specified user.
- **Selfie Capture**: Open a generated link to capture a selfie using your device's camera.
- **Spoiler Filter**: Snaps are sent as spoiler-protected images in Discord, ensuring privacy until the recipient chooses to view them.
- **Ephemeral Messaging**: Snaps automatically delete from Discord after 10 seconds, mimicking Snapchat's disappearing messages.

## How It Works
1. **Slash Command**: In Discord, use `/snap @username` to generate a link for capturing a selfie.
2. **Selfie Capture**: The link opens a web app (hosted on Vercel) that lets you capture a selfie using your device's camera.
3. **Image Processing**: The captured image is sent to a backend server (hosted on Fly.io), where it is formatted and sent to Discord via a webhook.
4. **Delivery**: The recipient receives a spoiler-protected snap in Discord that they can click to view. The snap disappears 10 seconds after being sent.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: 
  - Hosted on **Vercel** at [https://snipcord.vercel.app](https://snipcord.vercel.app).
  - Provides the UI for capturing selfies and communicating with the backend.
  - Built with responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility.

- **Backend**:
  - Hosted on **Fly.io** at [https://snipcord.fly.dev](https://snipcord.fly.dev).
  - Handles processing the selfie image and sending it to Discord using the webhook.

- **Discord Bot**:
  - Implements the `/snap` slash command to generate selfie links.
  - Sends ephemeral snaps to users in Discord.
